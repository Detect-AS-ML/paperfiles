CD: Cyclic Dependency

UD: Unstable Dependency

FC: Feature Concentration

LS: Lego Syndrome 

Introducion for each documents
## Datasets
In this folder, there are all datasets for MASs including raw datasets, strong correlation datasets and single features datasets. 
The number in filename mean the number of the features in datasets. Such as CD16 means there are 16 features in this CD datasets.

## Features Classification
The 56 features are classified into 4 categories including Size, Complexity, Coupling, Inheritance and we record them in details here.

## Figures
In this folder, all results of experiment comparsion are recorded here. There are three picture annotation in figures: the raw datasets means ML algorithms with raw datasets, 
the PCA means the PCA algorithm with ML(Machine Learning). 
and the F-x means our feature selection method (the number means the strong correlation features of each MASs such as F16 means there 16 strong correlation features).

##Single Feature Verification 
In this folder, the documents record the single feature experiment results for further evaluating our feature selection method.

## Strong Correlation Features 
In this file, the strong correlation features that selected by our feature selection method of each MASs are recorded.

## Results Table
In this folder, all experiments values are recorded. It is important to note that PCA algorithm with ML are also recorded here for evaluating our experiments. 
And the results of traditional detection method are showed in paper.
